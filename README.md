> * Project Title: A Smart City Creates Green Space; Can the U.S. implement "Super Blocks"?

## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

A Smart City promotes the health and prosperity of its citizenry.    Eliminating vehicular traffic in urban areas allows for the creation of green space used primarily by pedestrians.  Fewer cars on the roadway means reduced carbon emissions, increased oxygen intake, increased safety and an overall boost to public health both mentally and physically.  There appear to be almost no negative aspects of car free urban areas.  The question becomes, for cities in the US that were built around the extensive use of vehicular traffic; Can modern resources be used efficiently enough to make spending money on transforming urban culture worth the effort.  Electronic means can be used to monitor and manage public assets such as public transportation (rail lines), business deliveries, pedestrian and bike traffic and outside commuter parking.

Cities all oever the world have already implemented car free zones.  In Madrid, Spain, the Super Block implementation is a step toward pedestrianizing the central urban areas. Paris, France reduced overal carbon emmissions by 30% by reducing the number of cars and increasing Cities all oever the world have already implemented car free zones.  In Madrid, Spain, the Super Block implementation is a step toward pedestrianizing the central urban areas. Paris, France reduced overal carbon emmissions by 30% by reducing the number of cars and increasing public bike assess.  Chengdu, China is reducing vehicular traffic in urban areas with the promiss it will take only 15 min to transverse the car free zone, reducing overall "stalled in traffic" concerns.  Hamburg, Germany has plans to create a green network by reducing cars and inclreasing parks and reducing already croweded traffic systems.  These are just a few of the cities with reduced public bike assess.

Hamburg, Germany has plans to create a green network by reducing cars and inclreasing parks and reducing already croweded traffic systems.  These are just a few of the real-world examples.

The benefits of car free zone are exemplary: increased use of public transportation, reduction of carbon emissions, increase of oxygen levels, increase physical and mental health of city residents, increased safety.  The problem set this paper will explore is the timeframe necessary to traverse car free zones utilizing: public transportation such as a train or bus, bike lanes and/or walking.

## Requirements (Experimental Design)

(remove: You should start by specifying a set of requirements. I specified a topic Smart Cities but what exactly does that mean-  you should practice formulating your own set of requirements and an experiment. Define a hypothesis of a problem cities face and how a smart city would possibly help alleviate this issue. This helps you think about your problem communication and system objectives inputs, functions, and outputs - they should be clearly specified.)





## Smart City (My Problem) Model

(remove: add a high-level overview of your model, the part below should link to the model directory markdown files)
(remove: Look at the [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) for how to structure this part of Part 2 for each diagram. Only the Object diagram has the template, the rest are blank. )

* [**Object Diagram**](model/object_diagram.md) - provides the high level overview of components
* [**Class Diagram**](model/class_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Behavior Diagram**](model/behavior_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)
* [**Agent / User case** (if appropriate)](model/agent_usecase_diagram.md) - provides details of (what are you providing details of)

## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

(remove: for part 3 add two to three sentences here and link the [**(your own name)**](model/README.md) file in the analysis folder - which describe how you would simulate this - type of simulation, rough details -inputs, outputs - how it will help you analyze your experimental hypothesis, or nullify your null hypothesis.)
