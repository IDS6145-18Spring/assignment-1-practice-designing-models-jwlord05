## Smart City (My Problem) Simulation

This is a continuous based Monte Carlo simulation.  The model will need to be simulated multiple times in order to produce the average time for the commuter entity to travel from point A to point B.  This time of simulation was chosen becasue all agent choices are randomized (therefore not agent based) and nothing within the simulation changes overtime (therefore not discrete-event based).  The simulation mearly is run continously in order to gain the average time for a specific entity to travel from point A to point B.  At some point the average time may be changed by manipulating the number of tram/bike stops or moving the location of the commuter hubs.  However, those changes do not make the simulation more than a continous based simulation.
